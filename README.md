CIVIL-459 Final Project: Vision-based Vehicle Speed Estimation

This work is a part of ”Building AV Autopilot” Project of CIVIL-459 course at EPFL.

This work is aim to solve this problem by estimating the ego vehicle speed using only frames from a single front-facing monocular camera with a mask of the lane to preserve spatiotemporal features as input and receive high performance of vehicle speed estimation as output.
